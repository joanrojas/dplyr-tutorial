##dplyr-tutorial

I'm learning the in&out of dplyr, an R package for data manipulation. This tutorial was given in a conference
in LA (California) in November 2014. You can find Part I [here](http://datascience.la/hadley-wickhams-dplyr-tutorial-at-user-2014-part-1/) and Part II [here](http://www.r-bloggers.com/hadley-wickhams-dplyr-tutorial-at-user-2014-part-2/)

In these file I followed the videos above and completed the assignments on my own. I also took the chance to practice my skills on ggplot2. Next step is to create a shinyapp with this information.

RStudio is launching many interesting packages that try to cover all the aspects of the data science process.

tidyr to tidy the data

dplyr to manipulate and prepare
ggplot2 or ggvis for visualisations
I find very interesting to combine these two packages to perform quick analysis on the data, be it plots, summaries...

And for modelling... well, there are many many R packages for that.
