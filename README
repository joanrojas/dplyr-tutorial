##dplyr-tutorial

I'm learning the in&out of dplyr, an R package for data manipulation. This tutorial was given in a conference
in LA (California) in November 2014. You can find Part I [here](http://datascience.la/hadley-wickhams-dplyr-tutorial-at-user-2014-part-1/).

RStudio is launching many interesting packages that try to cover all the aspects of the data science process.
tidyr to tidy the data
dplyr to manipulate and prepare
ggplot2 or ggvis for visualisations
And for modelling... well, there are many many R packages for that.
